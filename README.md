# Weekly Challenge #36 - Challenge Running

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that helps me publish results for a challenge.** I feel so bad because I haven't judged the past 3 weeks challenges, but the manual pain of doing all the steps made me lose motivation. For this week challenge you need to help automate all this.

* Give me the ability to order the submissions and to add a one line blurb of what I think about each.
* Download the videos either attached or from youtube, and recompress them into a format that works on twitter/threads/facebook and under 10mb.
* Create a twitter thread like this (make sure you use people's twitter handle if they specify it on their github account): https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1835407337148076213
* Create a threads thread like this: https://www.threads.net/@vjeux/post/C_801KgTpDW
* Bonus point if you can automate posting on Meta Workplace (if you're not an employee it's going to be harder...): https://fb.workplace.com/groups/279027628526502
* Update the README with the submissions: https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-32-press-record
* Notify me of the people I need to send money to and how much.

If you feel like going above an beyond, automating the creating flow would be awesome as well. Need to take in a title, a $ amount, a picture, 3 blurbs (one bold, one explanation and one social media). And post to all the places mentioned above.
